Electromyographic (EMG) signals are an important type of bioelectrical signal that can help doctors figure out a lot of different neurological and muscular problems. The activity of muscles during contractions sends these electrical signals. The muscle fibers send out a small electrical current called an "electromyographic signal" (EMG) when the muscle contracts.

Block diagram of the design:

Electrode --> Preamplifier circuit --> Bandpass filter 20 - 500 Hz --> Non-inverting amplifier circuit --> Opscilloscope

Achievements:

+ Observed waveform changes when contracting the arm muscle.
+ Actively seek knowledge and experience from this project.

Non-Achievements:

+ Not yet optimized for waveform due to significant interference.
+ Accuracy is still low.
